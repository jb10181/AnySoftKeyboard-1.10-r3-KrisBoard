-------
I am unaffiliated with the AnySoftKeyboard project. Please refer to the links above to find the official project.

This project is simply a fork of AnySoftKeyboard-1.10-r3 with an additional bottom keyboard design called the Kris board. The Kris board has a larger spacebar than is available with the standard bottom keyboard designs. No longer will I add random periods between words!
